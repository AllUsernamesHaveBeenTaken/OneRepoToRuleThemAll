Projects
-------------------
The mission of Projects Committee is simple: some people want to work on things,
and others want to do things, we make it happen.

Got a project? Want to work on a project? Questions?  
Contact projects at <projects@sse.rit.edu>, or join the `#sse-projects` slack channel.

Contributing to projects is a great way to earn SSE membership!
